We have a set of $D$ features and want to choose a subset containing $b$ of them ($1\leq b\leq D$; the void set is not considered). The number of possible sets by choosing $b$ features from $D$ is:
\begin{equation*}
    \left(\begin{array}{c}D\\ b \end{array}\right)=\frac{D!}{(D-b)!\ b!}
\end{equation*}
The total number of set is obtained by summing for every value of $ b $:
\begin{equation*}
    |P(s)|=\sum_{i=1}^{D}\left(\begin{array}{c}D\\ i\end{array}\right)=2^{D}-1
\end{equation*}
Note that we used a well known formula:
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=0}^{D}\left(\begin{array}{c}D\\ i\end{array}\right)&=2^{D} \\
    \sum_{i=1}^{D}\left(\begin{array}{c}D\\ i\end{array}\right)
    &=\sum_{i=0}^{D}\left(\begin{array}{c}D\\ i\end{array}\right)-\left(\begin{array}{c}D\\ 0\end{array}\right)
\end{align*}
